## **What is PolyArena?**

Welcome to **PolyArena**, where we combine the thrill of predictions with the intensity of an elimination-style competition. Whether it's sports, crypto prices, or random world events—predict the outcome, stay in the game, and climb to the top.

But here's the twist—if you're wrong, you're **out**. That's right. One mistake and you’re out of the game. Only the sharpest, luckiest, or most tactical players make it to the end to claim the prize. 🎯

---

## **How It Works**

1. **Pay to Play**: Enter the contest pool with a small entry fee in SOL, USDC, or another SPL token.
2. **Rounds, Rounds, Rounds**: Each round presents a new challenge—predict the outcome of something big. (Bitcoin’s price, who wins a game, or something else crazy).
3. **Elimination**: Make a wrong prediction, and you’re out. Make a right prediction, and you advance to the next round.
4. **Win**: Be the last person standing or the most accurate, and you’ll claim the prize. 🏆
